# Stably Prime Number

# Requirements

Create a web application that takes in a number and returns to the user the highest prime number lower than the input number. For example an input of 55 would return 53. Treat this like a real production application that you would be proud of.

You will be graded on:

- Performance of algorithm
- User experience
- Test coverage
- Ease of deployment and best practices
- Git commit history
- Documentation
- Code readability and maintainability
- Anything else you would pay attention to in a software engineering position

Extra credit:

- Make your service more performant
- Containerize your application for a one line build experience
- Use Golang (1.11 or above with module support) and/or typescript
- Host and run your application on a cloud provider
